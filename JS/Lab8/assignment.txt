1. Create a module file called 'utils.js' that exports a function named 'greetUser' which takes a name parameter and returns "Hello, [name]!". Then import and use this function in another file.

2. Write a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds with the message "Task completed!". Use .then() to log the result to the console.

3. Create an async function called 'waitAndGreet' that uses setTimeout with a Promise to wait 1 second, then returns "Welcome!".

4. Write an async function that fetches user data from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1' and logs the user's name and email to the console.

5. Create a function that fetches the first 3 posts from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' and returns only their titles as an array.

6. Create a simple timer function using Promise that counts from 1 to 3, logging each number after 1 second intervals.

7. Write a function that safely parses JSON data with try/catch. Test it with both valid JSON string '{"name": "Omar"}' and invalid JSON '{name: Omar}'.

8. Create an async function that fetches data from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos', converts it to JSON, and returns the count of completed todos.

9. Build a simple module that exports a default class called 'DataFetcher' with a method 'getUser(id)' that fetches and returns user data from the JSONPlaceholder API.
